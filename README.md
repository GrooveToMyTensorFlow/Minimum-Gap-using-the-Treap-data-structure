# Minimum Gap

This project focuses on extending the Treap data structure, a binary search tree with randomized priorities, to efficiently support the computation of the minimum gap between any two elements. The minimum gap is the absolute difference between the two closest numbers in the treap.

## Method

1. `int MinGap()`: Return the absolute difference between the two closest numbers in the treap.

## Requirements

1. Describe in a separate document what additional data is needed and how that data is used to support an expected time complexity of O(1) for the MinGap method. Show as well that the methods Add and Remove can efficiently maintain this data as items are added and removed.

2. Re-implement the methods Add and Remove of the Treap class to maintain the augmented data in expected O(log n) time.

3. Implement and test the MinGap method.
